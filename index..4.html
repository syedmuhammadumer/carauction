		<div class="p" ><p>Today, Porsche’s Instagram page revealed what we’ve all been waiting for: a Star Wars and Porsche collaboration for the upcoming movie from Lucasfilms, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Okay, maybe you weren’t expecting this type of collaboration, and we weren’t either, but here it is anyway.</p></div>

		<div class="p"><p>Porsche, along with seven other well-known brands, came together to collectively reveal a new character named Babu Frik (pictured below) on their respective Instagram pages. (The other companies are United Airlines, Bose, Samsung, General Electric, McDonald’s, General Mills, and Dannon.)</p></div>

		<div class="p" ><p>Babu Frik is a tiny Anzellan droidsmith who works among the Spice Runners of Kijimi and can reprogram or modify any droid. We don’t know who the Spice Runners are or where Kijimi is, but rest assured we will before long.</p></div>
		<div class="p"><p>The collaboration comes on the heels of the reveal of the all new all-electric Porsche Taycan. The Taycan is quoted to have a sub-three-second zero-to-60-mph time, which for Star Wars fans is the equivalent of completing the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs. Porsche says that the U.S. launch of the Taycan will coincide with the release of The Rise of Skywalker. We contacted a spokesperson from Porsche who said: "Both brands share an iconic status, an enthusiastic fan base worldwide, and a reputation for timeless design. For now, Porsche and Lucasfilm have just announced the collaboration. More details of what to expect will follow in the coming weeks as we get closer to the December premiere of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker."</p></div>
