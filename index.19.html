		<div class="p"><p>With its 2020 update for the Civic hatchback lineup, Honda has remedied one of our few complaints with this model. While the sparsely equipped Sport trim level used to be the only trim available with the fantastic six-speed manual transmission, the Civic hatchback's fully loaded Sport Touring trim level is now offered with a stick. The Sport trim itself also gets more standard equipment for 2020 to go along with the minor styling tweaks that the 2020 Civic hatch now shares with the recently refreshed sedan and coupe models.</p></div>
		<div class="p"><p>Front-end styling changes include a slightly different bumper and grille along with darker headlight trim, and the rear bumper is reshaped. The wheel designs are new. Inside, certain trim levels get different trim patterns, and all models get additional sound deadening that should quiet the cabin somewhat.</p></div>
		<div style="margin-left: 500px"><img src="imgs 2/45.PNG" width="1000px" height="700px"></div>
		<div class="p"><p>New standard features for the 10Best-winning Civic Sport hatchback include a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (it previously had a tiny, non-touchscreen display with few connectivity functions) and a proximity-key system. A power driver's seat is newly standard on the EX hatch.</p></div>
		<div class="p"><p>The base price goes up $200, with the 2020 Civic hatch starting at $22,580 for the base LX trim, and other trim levels rise by $100 to $500. The new manual-transmission Sport Touring model starts at $28,980. The 2020 Civic hatch will be at dealerships starting August 16.</p></div>
