		<div class="p"><p>Read everything we have to say about the mid-engined 2020 Chevy Corvette, and see the Corvette configurator to spec your own.Of all the impressive numbers associated with the 2020 Chevrolet Corvette—495 horsepower, 194 mph, less than three seconds to 60 mph—none is as impressive as the $59,995 starting price. But let's be real here: No one is buying a base-price Corvette.</p></div>

			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="p" ><p>The Corvette Stingray is offered in three cleverly named trims: 1LT, 2LT, and 3LT. We'd opt for the middle one and happily pay the $7300 upcharge, as it adds desirable convenience features such as heated and ventilated seats, satellite radio, a 14-speaker Bose audio system, a wireless phone charger, and the slick Performance Data Recorder, which captures your track-day exploits on video—great for someday showing your grandkids how cool you once were. It also includes a front curb-view camera, a rearview camera mirror, and blind-spot monitoring to help you spot hazards from the cockpit of your low and wide mid-engine sports car.</p></div>

In the interest of preserving the Corvette's value proposition, we'd skip the deluxe trimmings. If it's a luxury car you want, buy a Mercedes-</p></div>
