		<div class="p"><p>The Toyota C-HR prides itself on its extroverted styling, and it's getting a slightly different look for 2020. Tweaks to the front bumper, headlights, grille, and rear spoiler make for a slightly sleeker look, all trims now come standard with LED headlights that look more modern, and both 17- and 18-inch wheels options are restyled.</p></div>
		<div class="p" ><p>Apple CarPlay was previously standard for the C-HR's touchscreen infotainment system, but it now gets standard Android Auto as well. Other newly available features include SiriusXM satellite radio for the base LE, seatback pockets for the XLE, and a power driver's seat and adaptive headlights for the Limited.</p></div>

		<div class="p" ><p>Two-tone color options are still available, but a silver roof option replaces the previous white roof (the black roof option remains). Supersonic Red and Hot Lava orange paint colors join the option sheet, as does a blue and black two-tone interior treatment for the XLE model.</p></div>
		<div class="p" ><p>There are no mechanical changes to the 2020 C-HR. It remains available with a single powertrain, a 2.0-liter inline-four mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission and front-wheel drive.</p></div>
		<div class="p" ><p>Pricing rises a mere $150, with the 2020 C-HR LE starting at $22,415, the XLE starting at $24,450, and the Limited starting at $27,470. The updated C-HR is on sale at dealerships now.</p></div>
