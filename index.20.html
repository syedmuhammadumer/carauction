		<div class="p" ><p>The first mid-engined Corvette I remember was the Astro II concept car on the cover of Road & Track in July 1968—when I was a junior in high school. It looked very low, impossibly sleek, with lean yet seductively curved lines. It helped that it was unblemished by air intakes or blunted by pedestrian crash standards. To my eye, it wasn't quite as stunning as the Lamborghini Miura or the De Tomaso Mangusta, but it was in the ballpark. Pretty damn great for Chevrolet.</p></div>
		<div class="p" ><p>Had Chevy pulled the production trigger on some version of that car 50 years ago, the Corvette would have jumped immediately to the leading edge of sports-car design, especially compared to the C3, which was little more than an exaggerated psychedelic reskin of the C2, with which we were stuck for 17 years. Going mid-engine today has far less impact.</p></div>
		<div class="p" ><p>But still . . . the least expensive mid-engined car on the market with serious power—the Acura NSX—starts at about $160K, more than two and a half times the C8's promised base price. That's the kind of value that makes even Corvette-scorning, free-spending Porsche owners take notice.</p></div>
		<div class="p" ><p>No outsiders have driven the C8 (although we have ridden in a prototype). I'm not worried on that front with my old friend Tadge Juechter honchoing the program. He's as capable and dedicated a vehicle engineer as there is in the business. I have no doubt that the car will be capable and satisfying to drive quickly.</p></div>
		<div class="p" ><p>I'm less sanguine about the engine. Yeah, I know all about the weight, size, and cost advantages of the pushrod engine whose lineage stretches from 1955. But a few years ago, after driving a C7 Corvette and a Mustang GT back to back at 10Best, I couldn't help wishing that the Vette had the smoother, revvier, and more melodious Ford Coyote V-8. In 2019, pushrods should be consigned to snow blowers—and maybe pickups. And while I would love to have a proper manual transmission, past experiences were not encouraging. The shifter in the C7 was pretty awful—and the linkage didn't have to circumnavigate an engine as would be required in the C8.</p></div>
		<div class="p" ><p>As to the C8's look, it wasn't love at first sight. It seems a bit stocky compared with contemporary mid-engined sports cars like the Ferrari 488 or any McLaren. But then those cars aren't tasked with carrying two golf bags—as if owners of expensive sports cars don't have alternative transportation. But as I studied the shape a bit more, and remembered that Corvette styling is more about excitement than beauty, I started to appreciate the way that past Corvette cues like the pointy nose, the sharp-edged wedgy shape, and the muscular fenders were integrated into the completely new architecture.</p></div>

		<div class="p" ><p>Of course, there's always the interior. I haven't sat in the C8, but ever since the C4, Chevrolet has promised upgraded Corvette interiors, and the company has made a big enough advance. My 2017 Porsche 911 has a cabin that looks richer and is more meticulously executed than any interior that General Motors builds. Will the C8 be as good?</p></div>
		<div class="p" ><p>The C8's performance is a given. The questions concern powertrain satisfaction, the interior execution, and the overall refinement. If those areas come through, the car will be a winner. If not, it will get a second chance when the modern overhead-cam V-8 arrives, hopefully sooner rather than later.</p></div>
