		<li style="margin-left: 600px"><strong>The compact hatchback previews future Hyundai design direction as well as future electric-vehicle technology.</strong></li>

		<div class="p"><p>Although it was inspired by a concept car from 45 years ago–hence its name–the Hyundai 45 concept that the Korean automaker unveiled today at the Frankfurt auto show gives us a glimpse of both future design direction and a potential future electric vehicle. The brand's current EV offerings include the Kona Electric SUV and the Ioniq hatchback.</p></div>

		<div class="p"><p>Sharp lines stand in contrast to the more rounded styling of today's Hyundais, and the lack of door handles and exterior mirrors give the 45 concept a very smooth, futuristic appearance. LED lights serving as the head- and taillamps are arranged in to provide a three-dimensional effect, and additional lighting elements on the side of the vehicle provides a quick way to check the vehicle's state of charge upon approach.</p></div>
		<div class="p"><p>The 45 Concept's cabin looks downright Scandinavian in its design, with light-colored wood making up the bottom part of the curved dashboard and serving as the backs of both the front and rear seats. The driver sits before a very large digital panel that spans two-thirds the length of the dashboard.</p></div>

		<div class="p"><p>Egress and ingress are aided by front and rear doors that slide open to create a wide, uninterrupted opening. In a nod to the past, the front seats also swivel toward the open door, a feature that made it to production on some 1960s and 1970s vehicles.</p></div>
		<div class="p"><p>Hyundai says the 45 concept rolls on a "skateboard" platform that houses the car's battery pack; it's possible that Hyundai is exploring such a setup to prepare to take on Volkswagen's upcoming MEB modular EV platform that can accommodate a number of different body styles, including the nostalgic Microbus.</p></div>
		<div class="p"><p>Even if the 45 concept's technology doesn't reach production, we're impressed by the car's futuristic good looks. If you'd like to see the concept car in person and happen to be in Germany during September, the Frankfurt auto show will be open to the public from Saturday, September 14, through Saturday, September 22.</p></div>
