		<div class="p" ><p>McLaren today released a veiled rendering of its new Ultimate Series roadster. In a textbook example of playing to your audience, McLaren CEO Mike Flewitt said he will officially share the rendering during a customer briefing later today at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. While the current image is far from revealing, it displays enough of the brand's trademark style that devoted fans of the brand and the idle rich are surely reaching for their checkbooks, intending to secure one of the 399 examples of the so far unnamed model. We're hoping additional images will be released with the customer briefing.</p></div>
	    <div class="p" ><p>Referred to as an all-new Ultimate Series McLaren supercar, the new roadster is intended to slot in between the Senna and the Speedtail, trading their clinical performance for, as McLaren puts it, "the purest distillation of road-focused driving pleasure and an unrivaled sense of driver connection with the surrounding environment." Citing its classic roadster proportions and low-profile dihedral doors, McLaren insists the new roadster is designed more for the road than the track.</p></div>
		<div class="p" ><p>The car uses McLaren's signature carbon-fiber construction, and it's claimed to be the lightest the company makes. Motivation will be provided by a version of the twin-turbocharged V-8 engine currently in the McLaren Senna.</p></div>
		<div class="p" ><p>Although little more is currently known, McLaren will be taking "expressions of interest" from current customers at the Pebble Beach Concours dâ€™Elegance over the course of the weekend. Expect its price to fall between the current McLaren Senna ($959,000) and Speedtail (approximately $2.6 million) when it becomes available in 2020. We will bring more details when we have them.</p></div>
