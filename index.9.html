		<li style="margin-left: 600px"><strong>The Night Edition returns for 2020 Ram 1500 Big Horn and Laramie 1500 models.</strong></li>
		<li style="margin-left: 600px"><strong>The Ram Heavy Duty now offers lane-keeping assist, adaptive steering, blind-spot monitoring, and two new exterior colors: Olive Green and Hydro Blue.</strong></li>
	    <li style="margin-left: 600px"><strong>A Comfort package is now standard on the Rebel; it includes a power tailgate release, wireless charging, heated rear seats, and a 12-way power driver’s seat.</strong></li>

		<div class="p"><p>Rust, it's said, never sleeps, and neither does the revision of features and specifications in the full-size pickup truck market. For 2020, the constant reshuffle is led at Ram by the introduction of a Night Edition—but, no, it doesn't just mean an all-black pickup.</p></div>

		<div class="p"><p>Available on the Big Horn and Laramie trims, the Night Edition features a black grille and grille surround, specific badging and wheels (20-inch on Big Horn, 22-inch on Laramie), exhaust tips, and dark bezels for head and taillamps. Color choices are more varied than might be expected, including Bright White on the Big Horn, Ivory White on the Laramie, plus Flame Red, Billet Silver, Granite Crystal, and Diamond Black. The Night Edition really only involves minor changes, but the overall effect is distinctive and should resonate well with a large swath of the buyers.</p></div>

		<div class="p" ><p>The 2020 Rebel, seen above in the back-for-2020 Black Appearance Group, gets a new safety package option that includes adaptive cruise control with full stop, forward-collision mitigation, lane-departure warning, and automatic high-beam headlamps. The Comfort package is now standard and includes a power tailgate release, wireless phone charging, rear heated seats, and a 12-way power driver's seat with memory settings. Additionally, new Rebel exterior graphics options will be on offer.</p></div>

		<div class="p" ><p>Additional changes for the 2020 1500 lineup include available blind-spot monitoring for the Tradesman, an optional 22-inch two-tone wheel style for the Longhorn, New eTorque hood badging, and three new exterior colors to be introduced later in the model year: Hydro Blue, RV Match Walnut Brown, and Olive Green.</p></div>

		<div class="p" ><p>Revisions for the 2020 Ram HD trucks include optional lane-keeping assist, adaptive steering, and trailer tire-pressure monitoring on all trim levels; blind-spot monitoring, including trailer coverage, is now available on certain models. The optional auxiliary camera system now supports two separate cameras. Crew-cab models with an 8.0-foot bed now get a standard 50-gallon fuel tank, and the Power Wagon can get optional black wheels. The two new colors Hydro Blue and Olive Green are also available on the HDs.</p></div>
